With this hands-on book, you can master the fundamentals of the core Python language quickly and efficiently, whether you're new to programming or just new to Python. Once you finish, you will know enough about the language to use it in any application domain you choose. Learning Python is based on material from author Mark Lutz's popular training courses, which he's taught over the past decade. Each chapter is a self-contained lesson that helps you thoroughly understand a key component of Python before you continue. Along with plenty of annotated examples, illustrations, and chapter summaries, every chapter also contains Brain Builder, a unique section with practical exercises and review quizzes that let you practice new skills and test your understanding as you go. This book covers: Types and Operations -- Python's major built-in object types in depth: numbers, lists, dictionaries, and more Statements and Syntax -- the code you type to create and process objects in Python, along with Python's general syntax model Functions -- Python's basic procedural tool for structuring and reusing code Modules -- packages of statements, functions, and other tools organized into larger components Classes and OOP -- Python's optional object-oriented programming tool for structuring code for customization and reuse Exceptions and Tools -- exception handling model and statements, plus a look at development tools for writing larger programs Learning Python gives you a deep and complete understanding of the language that will help you comprehend any application-level examples of Python that you later encounter. If you're ready to discover what Google and YouTube see in Python, this book is the best way to get started.\",\n",

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.\",\n",

              "    'description': 'Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This book covers: Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects Data structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age Functions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns Object-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance Control flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages Metaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work',\n",

In the first half of the book, you’ll learn about basic programming concepts, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. You’ll also learn how to make your programs interactive and how to test your code safely before adding it to a project. In the second half of the book, you’ll put your new knowledge into practice with three substantial projects: a Space Invaders–inspired arcade game, data visualizations with Python’s super-handy libraries, and a simple web app you can deploy online. As you work through Python Crash Course you’ll learn how to: –Use powerful Python libraries and tools, including matplotlib, NumPy, and Pygal –Make 2D games that respond to keypresses and mouse clicks, and that grow more difficult as the game progresses –Work with data to generate interactive visualizations –Create and customize Web apps and deploy them safely online –Deal with mistakes and errors so you can solve your own programming problems If you’ve been thinking seriously about digging into programming, Python Crash Course will get you up to speed and have you writing real programs fast. Why wait any longer? Start your engines and code! Uses Python 2 and 3',\n",

Students and researchers at all levels are increasingly turning to the powerful Python programming language as an alternative to commercial packages and this fast-paced introduction moves from the basics to advanced concepts in one complete volume, enabling readers to gain proficiency quickly. Beginning with general programming concepts such as loops and functions within the core Python 3 language, and moving on to the NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib libraries for numerical programming and data visualization, this textbook also discusses the use of Jupyter Notebooks to build rich-media, shareable documents for scientific analysis. The second edition features a new chapter on data analysis with the pandas library and comprehensive updates, and new exercises and examples. A final chapter introduces more advanced topics such as floating-point precision and algorithm stability, and extensive online resources support further study. This textbook represents a targeted package for students requiring a solid foundation in Python programming.',\n",

What's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer? Welcome to Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language. You'll learn: Coding style, and how to use Python's Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions How to profile the speed of your code with Python's built-in timeit and cProfile modules The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code Toward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. You'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself. Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer, as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic Requirements: Covers Python 3.6 and higher\",\n",

Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs. What you will learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Extend class functionality using inheritance Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important Learn to statically type check your dynamic code Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs Who this book is for If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.\",\n",

In all of these areas, experienced professionals can find examples of inefficiency, problems, and other perils, as a result of bad code. After reading this book, readers will understand these problems, and more importantly, how to correct them. The book begins by describing the basic elements of writing clean code and how it plays an important role in Python programming. You will learn about writing efficient and readable code using the Python standard library and best practices for software design. You will learn to implement the SOLID principles in Python and use decorators to improve your code. The book delves more deeply into object oriented programming in Python and shows you how to use objects with descriptors and generators. It will also show you the design principles of software testing and how to resolve software problems by implementing design patterns in your code. In the final chapter we break down a monolithic application to a microservice one, starting from the code as the basis for a solid platform. By the end of the book, you will be proficient in applying industry approved coding practices to design clean, sustainable and readable Python code. What you will learn Set up tools to effectively work in a development environment Explore how the magic methods of Python can help us write better code Examine the traits of Python to create advanced object-oriented design Understand removal of duplicated code using decorators and descriptors Effectively refactor code with the help of unit tests Learn to implement the SOLID principles in Python Who this book is for This book will appeal to team leads, software architects and senior software engineers who would like to work on their legacy systems to save cost and improve efficiency.

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python. These labs will be useful both for Python novices, as well as experienced users.',\n",

But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. You'll learn how to: –Automate tedious reversing and security tasks –Design and program your own debugger –Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch –Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery –Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session –Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork. Shouldn't you?\",\n",

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that’s no fun for anyone. Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side. Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you’ll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more. As you strike out on your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to: –Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps –Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules –Use control structures like loops and conditional statements –Draw shapes and patterns with Python’s turtle module –Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter Why should serious adults have all the fun? Python for Kids is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming. For kids ages 10+ (and their parents) The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!',\n",

If you’ve mastered basic Python syntax and you’re ready to start writing programs, you’ll find The Big Book of Small Python Projects both enlightening and fun. This collection of 81 Python projects will have you making digital art, games, animations, counting pro- grams, and more right away. Once you see how the code works, you’ll practice re-creating the programs and experiment by adding your own custom touches. These simple, text-based programs are 256 lines of code or less. And whether it’s a vintage screensaver, a snail-racing game, a clickbait headline generator, or animated strands of DNA, each project is designed to be self-contained so you can easily share it online. You’ll create: • Hangman, Blackjack, and other games to play against your friends or the computer • Simulations of a forest fire, a million dice rolls, and a Japanese abacus • Animations like a virtual fish tank, a rotating cube, and a bouncing DVD logo screensaver • A first-person 3D maze game • Encryption programs that use ciphers like ROT13 and Vigenère to conceal text If you’re tired of standard step-by-step tutorials, you’ll love the learn-by-doing approach of The Big Book of Small Python Projects.

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward. With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture) Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage Events, commands, and the message bus Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices',\n",

Despite this, the text builds up to advanced topics such as automated testing, creating documentation, versioning and updating a package, and implementing continuous integration and deployment. Covering the entire Python packaging life cycle, this essential guide takes readers from package creation all the way to effective maintenance and updating. Python Packages focuses on the use of current and best-practice packaging tools and services like poetry, cookiecutter, pytest, sphinx, GitHub, and GitHub Actions. Features: The book’s source code is available online as a GitHub repository where it is collaborated on, automatically tested, and built in real time as changes are made; demonstrating the use of good reproducible and clear project workflows. Covers not just the process of creating a package, but also how to document it, test it, publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI), and how to properly version and update it. All concepts in the book are demonstrated using examples. Readers can follow along, creating their own Python packages using the reproducible code provided in the text. Focuses on a modern approach to Python packaging with emphasis on automating and streamlining the packaging process using new and emerging tools such as poetry and GitHub Actions.',\n",

With code and relevant case studies, this book will show how you can use industry-grade tools to implement NLP programs capable of learning from relevant data. We will explore many modern methods ranging from spaCy to word vectors that have reinvented NLP. The book takes you from the basics of NLP to building text processing applications. We start with an introduction to the basic vocabulary along with a workflow for building NLP applications. We use industry-grade NLP tools for cleaning and pre-processing text, automatic question and answer generation using linguistics, text embedding, text classifier, and building a chatbot. With each project, you will learn a new concept of NLP. You will learn about entity recognition, part of speech tagging and dependency parsing for Q and A. We use text embedding for both clustering documents and making chatbots, and then build classifiers using scikit-learn. We conclude by deploying these models as REST APIs with Flask. By the end, you will be confident building NLP applications, and know exactly what to look for when approaching new challenges. What you will learnUnderstand classical linguistics in using English grammar for automatically generating questions and answers from a free text corpusWork with text embedding models for dense number representations of words, subwords and characters in the English language for exploring document clusteringDeep Learning in NLP using PyTorch with a code-driven introduction to PyTorchUsing an NLP project management Framework for estimating timelines and organizing your project into stagesHack and build a simple chatbot application in 30 minutesDeploy an NLP or machine learning application using Flask as RESTFUL APIsWho this book is for Programmers who wish to build systems that can interpret language.

This book is designed in such a way that you start from basics, followed by advance levels and then move on to some industry-related modules.Ê The initial chapters are written in a simple manner; some chapters are of advanceÊlevel. Start from the data structure of Python, such as string, list, tuple, and dictionary. The function and module chapter will let you know how to organize a large code. The built-in functions and modulesÊlike collections will give you greater flexibility to write efficient codes. The \"time\" chapter is very important when we deal with time-related things.ÊÊ The mid-chapter contains the advance chapters such as regular expressions, interactionÊwith OS, and multithreading. These chapters are helpful when we want to search the pattern, run the OS commands, and execute the program in parallel. The last chapters are specially designed from an industry point of view.ÊIn order to ensure a high quality of code, we use config-parser to avoid hard-coding and logger to log the events. In the multiprocessing and subprocess chapter, you will learn creation, execution, and communication between the processes.Ê KEY FEATURESÊÊ Start from basics of PythonÊ Control statement, loop structure, break, continue, and pass statementÊ Detailed description of Python data types: string, tuple, list, and dictionary with the help of example Organizing code using function, modules, and packages Saving text and complex data in text, pickle, and JSON files Learn the use of time and time zones Parallel execution with the help of threading, multiprocessing, and subprocessing Helpful modules for industry WHAT WILL YOU LEARNÊ Python for developers is created by taking beginner and intermediate programmers. The book starts from scratch and takes you to the advanced level. After learning advance levels, you will learn parallel programming using multithreading, multiprocessing, and sub-processing. The book will provide information on modules which will be helpful form industry perspective. The book also contains the question for the preparation of the interview. You will also learn the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. Some of the chapters include an advance part, which will give an in-depth knowledge of the chapters.Ê WHO THIS BOOK IS FORÊÊ This book is for whoever wants to learn Python and aspires to become a developer or work on projects. Beginners can read this book easily; however, a little knowledge about the programming concepts would be helpful. Basic knowledge of computers would suffice. Table of Contents 1.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you\\'ll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python\\'s great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python\\'s newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft\\'s newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python\\'s built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer\\'s library. Praise for the First Edition: \"In a nutshell, Python in a Nutshell serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\" --Richard Cobbett, Linux Format \"O\\'Reilly has several good books, of which Python in aNutshell by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\" --Jerry Pournelle, Byte Magazine',\n",

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.\",\n",

              "    'description': 'Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This book covers: Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects Data structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age Functions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns Object-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance Control flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages Metaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work',\n",

Students and researchers at all levels are increasingly turning to the powerful Python programming language as an alternative to commercial packages and this fast-paced introduction moves from the basics to advanced concepts in one complete volume, enabling readers to gain proficiency quickly. Beginning with general programming concepts such as loops and functions within the core Python 3 language, and moving on to the NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib libraries for numerical programming and data visualization, this textbook also discusses the use of Jupyter Notebooks to build rich-media, shareable documents for scientific analysis. The second edition features a new chapter on data analysis with the pandas library and comprehensive updates, and new exercises and examples. A final chapter introduces more advanced topics such as floating-point precision and algorithm stability, and extensive online resources support further study. This textbook represents a targeted package for students requiring a solid foundation in Python programming.',\n",

What's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer? Welcome to Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language. You'll learn: Coding style, and how to use Python's Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions How to profile the speed of your code with Python's built-in timeit and cProfile modules The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code Toward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. You'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself. Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer, as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic Requirements: Covers Python 3.6 and higher\",\n",

Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs. What you will learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Extend class functionality using inheritance Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important Learn to statically type check your dynamic code Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs Who this book is for If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.\",\n",

In all of these areas, experienced professionals can find examples of inefficiency, problems, and other perils, as a result of bad code. After reading this book, readers will understand these problems, and more importantly, how to correct them. The book begins by describing the basic elements of writing clean code and how it plays an important role in Python programming. You will learn about writing efficient and readable code using the Python standard library and best practices for software design. You will learn to implement the SOLID principles in Python and use decorators to improve your code. The book delves more deeply into object oriented programming in Python and shows you how to use objects with descriptors and generators. It will also show you the design principles of software testing and how to resolve software problems by implementing design patterns in your code. In the final chapter we break down a monolithic application to a microservice one, starting from the code as the basis for a solid platform. By the end of the book, you will be proficient in applying industry approved coding practices to design clean, sustainable and readable Python code. What you will learn Set up tools to effectively work in a development environment Explore how the magic methods of Python can help us write better code Examine the traits of Python to create advanced object-oriented design Understand removal of duplicated code using decorators and descriptors Effectively refactor code with the help of unit tests Learn to implement the SOLID principles in Python Who this book is for This book will appeal to team leads, software architects and senior software engineers who would like to work on their legacy systems to save cost and improve efficiency.

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python. These labs will be useful both for Python novices, as well as experienced users.',\n",

But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. You'll learn how to: –Automate tedious reversing and security tasks –Design and program your own debugger –Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch –Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery –Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session –Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork. Shouldn't you?\",\n",

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that’s no fun for anyone. Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side. Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you’ll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more. As you strike out on your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to: –Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps –Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules –Use control structures like loops and conditional statements –Draw shapes and patterns with Python’s turtle module –Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter Why should serious adults have all the fun? Python for Kids is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming. For kids ages 10+ (and their parents) The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!',\n",

If you’ve mastered basic Python syntax and you’re ready to start writing programs, you’ll find The Big Book of Small Python Projects both enlightening and fun. This collection of 81 Python projects will have you making digital art, games, animations, counting pro- grams, and more right away. Once you see how the code works, you’ll practice re-creating the programs and experiment by adding your own custom touches. These simple, text-based programs are 256 lines of code or less. And whether it’s a vintage screensaver, a snail-racing game, a clickbait headline generator, or animated strands of DNA, each project is designed to be self-contained so you can easily share it online. You’ll create: • Hangman, Blackjack, and other games to play against your friends or the computer • Simulations of a forest fire, a million dice rolls, and a Japanese abacus • Animations like a virtual fish tank, a rotating cube, and a bouncing DVD logo screensaver • A first-person 3D maze game • Encryption programs that use ciphers like ROT13 and Vigenère to conceal text If you’re tired of standard step-by-step tutorials, you’ll love the learn-by-doing approach of The Big Book of Small Python Projects.

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward. With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture) Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage Events, commands, and the message bus Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices',\n",

Covering the entire Python packaging life cycle, this essential guide takes readers from package creation all the way to effective maintenance and updating. Python Packages focuses on the use of current and best-practice packaging tools and services like poetry, cookiecutter, pytest, sphinx, GitHub, and GitHub Actions. Features: The book’s source code is available online as a GitHub repository where it is collaborated on, automatically tested, and built in real time as changes are made; demonstrating the use of good reproducible and clear project workflows. Covers not just the process of creating a package, but also how to document it, test it, publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI), and how to properly version and update it. All concepts in the book are demonstrated using examples. Readers can follow along, creating their own Python packages using the reproducible code provided in the text. Focuses on a modern approach to Python packaging with emphasis on automating and streamlining the packaging process using new and emerging tools such as poetry and GitHub Actions.',\n",

With code and relevant case studies, this book will show how you can use industry-grade tools to implement NLP programs capable of learning from relevant data. We will explore many modern methods ranging from spaCy to word vectors that have reinvented NLP. The book takes you from the basics of NLP to building text processing applications. We start with an introduction to the basic vocabulary along with a workflow for building NLP applications. We use industry-grade NLP tools for cleaning and pre-processing text, automatic question and answer generation using linguistics, text embedding, text classifier, and building a chatbot. With each project, you will learn a new concept of NLP. You will learn about entity recognition, part of speech tagging and dependency parsing for Q and A. We use text embedding for both clustering documents and making chatbots, and then build classifiers using scikit-learn. We conclude by deploying these models as REST APIs with Flask. By the end, you will be confident building NLP applications, and know exactly what to look for when approaching new challenges. What you will learnUnderstand classical linguistics in using English grammar for automatically generating questions and answers from a free text corpusWork with text embedding models for dense number representations of words, subwords and characters in the English language for exploring document clusteringDeep Learning in NLP using PyTorch with a code-driven introduction to PyTorchUsing an NLP project management Framework for estimating timelines and organizing your project into stagesHack and build a simple chatbot application in 30 minutesDeploy an NLP or machine learning application using Flask as RESTFUL APIsWho this book is for Programmers who wish to build systems that can interpret language.

This book is designed in such a way that you start from basics, followed by advance levels and then move on to some industry-related modules.Ê The initial chapters are written in a simple manner; some chapters are of advanceÊlevel. Start from the data structure of Python, such as string, list, tuple, and dictionary. The function and module chapter will let you know how to organize a large code. The built-in functions and modulesÊlike collections will give you greater flexibility to write efficient codes. The \"time\" chapter is very important when we deal with time-related things.ÊÊ The mid-chapter contains the advance chapters such as regular expressions, interactionÊwith OS, and multithreading. These chapters are helpful when we want to search the pattern, run the OS commands, and execute the program in parallel. The last chapters are specially designed from an industry point of view.ÊIn order to ensure a high quality of code, we use config-parser to avoid hard-coding and logger to log the events. In the multiprocessing and subprocess chapter, you will learn creation, execution, and communication between the processes.Ê KEY FEATURESÊÊ Start from basics of PythonÊ Control statement, loop structure, break, continue, and pass statementÊ Detailed description of Python data types: string, tuple, list, and dictionary with the help of example Organizing code using function, modules, and packages Saving text and complex data in text, pickle, and JSON files Learn the use of time and time zones Parallel execution with the help of threading, multiprocessing, and subprocessing Helpful modules for industry WHAT WILL YOU LEARNÊ Python for developers is created by taking beginner and intermediate programmers. The book starts from scratch and takes you to the advanced level. After learning advance levels, you will learn parallel programming using multithreading, multiprocessing, and sub-processing. The book will provide information on modules which will be helpful form industry perspective. The book also contains the question for the preparation of the interview. You will also learn the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. Some of the chapters include an advance part, which will give an in-depth knowledge of the chapters.Ê WHO THIS BOOK IS FORÊÊ This book is for whoever wants to learn Python and aspires to become a developer or work on projects. Beginners can read this book easily; however, a little knowledge about the programming concepts would be helpful. Basic knowledge of computers would suffice. Table of Contents 1.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you\\'ll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python\\'s great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python\\'s newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft\\'s newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python\\'s built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer\\'s library. Praise for the First Edition: \"In a nutshell, Python in a Nutshell serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\" --Richard Cobbett, Linux Format \"O\\'Reilly has several good books, of which Python in aNutshell by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\" --Jerry Pournelle, Byte Magazine',\n",

With this hands-on book, you can master the fundamentals of the core Python language quickly and efficiently, whether you're new to programming or just new to Python. Once you finish, you will know enough about the language to use it in any application domain you choose. Learning Python is based on material from author Mark Lutz's popular training courses, which he's taught over the past decade. Each chapter is a self-contained lesson that helps you thoroughly understand a key component of Python before you continue. Along with plenty of annotated examples, illustrations, and chapter summaries, every chapter also contains Brain Builder, a unique section with practical exercises and review quizzes that let you practice new skills and test your understanding as you go. This book covers: Types and Operations -- Python's major built-in object types in depth: numbers, lists, dictionaries, and more Statements and Syntax -- the code you type to create and process objects in Python, along with Python's general syntax model Functions -- Python's basic procedural tool for structuring and reusing code Modules -- packages of statements, functions, and other tools organized into larger components Classes and OOP -- Python's optional object-oriented programming tool for structuring code for customization and reuse Exceptions and Tools -- exception handling model and statements, plus a look at development tools for writing larger programs Learning Python gives you a deep and complete understanding of the language that will help you comprehend any application-level examples of Python that you later encounter. If you're ready to discover what Google and YouTube see in Python, this book is the best way to get started.\",\n",

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.\",\n",

              "   'description': 'Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This book covers: Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects Data structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age Functions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns Object-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance Control flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages Metaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work',\n",

What's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer? Welcome to Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language. You'll learn: Coding style, and how to use Python's Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions How to profile the speed of your code with Python's built-in timeit and cProfile modules The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code Toward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. You'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself. Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer, as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic Requirements: Covers Python 3.6 and higher\",\n",

Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs. What you will learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Extend class functionality using inheritance Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important Learn to statically type check your dynamic code Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs Who this book is for If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.\",\n",

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python. These labs will be useful both for Python novices, as well as experienced users.',\n",

But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. You'll learn how to: –Automate tedious reversing and security tasks –Design and program your own debugger –Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch –Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery –Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session –Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork.

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that’s no fun for anyone. Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side. Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you’ll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more. As you strike out on your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to: –Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps –Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules –Use control structures like loops and conditional statements –Draw shapes and patterns with Python’s turtle module –Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter Why should serious adults have all the fun? Python for Kids is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming. For kids ages 10+ (and their parents) The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!',\n",

This collection of 81 Python projects will have you making digital art, games, animations, counting pro- grams, and more right away. Once you see how the code works, you’ll practice re-creating the programs and experiment by adding your own custom touches. These simple, text-based programs are 256 lines of code or less. And whether it’s a vintage screensaver, a snail-racing game, a clickbait headline generator, or animated strands of DNA, each project is designed to be self-contained so you can easily share it online. You’ll create: • Hangman, Blackjack, and other games to play against your friends or the computer • Simulations of a forest fire, a million dice rolls, and a Japanese abacus • Animations like a virtual fish tank, a rotating cube, and a bouncing DVD logo screensaver • A first-person 3D maze game • Encryption programs that use ciphers like ROT13 and Vigenère to conceal text If you’re tired of standard step-by-step tutorials, you’ll love the learn-by-doing approach of The Big Book of Small Python Projects.

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward. With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture) Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage Events, commands, and the message bus Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices',\n",

With code and relevant case studies, this book will show how you can use industry-grade tools to implement NLP programs capable of learning from relevant data. We will explore many modern methods ranging from spaCy to word vectors that have reinvented NLP. The book takes you from the basics of NLP to building text processing applications. We start with an introduction to the basic vocabulary along with a workflow for building NLP applications. We use industry-grade NLP tools for cleaning and pre-processing text, automatic question and answer generation using linguistics, text embedding, text classifier, and building a chatbot. With each project, you will learn a new concept of NLP. You will learn about entity recognition, part of speech tagging and dependency parsing for Q and A. We use text embedding for both clustering documents and making chatbots, and then build classifiers using scikit-learn. We conclude by deploying these models as REST APIs with Flask. By the end, you will be confident building NLP applications, and know exactly what to look for when approaching new challenges. What you will learnUnderstand classical linguistics in using English grammar for automatically generating questions and answers from a free text corpusWork with text embedding models for dense number representations of words, subwords and characters in the English language for exploring document clusteringDeep Learning in NLP using PyTorch with a code-driven introduction to PyTorchUsing an NLP project management Framework for estimating timelines and organizing your project into stagesHack and build a simple chatbot application in 30 minutesDeploy an NLP or machine learning application using Flask as RESTFUL APIsWho this book is for Programmers who wish to build systems that can interpret language.

This book is designed in such a way that you start from basics, followed by advance levels and then move on to some industry-related modules.Ê The initial chapters are written in a simple manner; some chapters are of advanceÊlevel. Start from the data structure of Python, such as string, list, tuple, and dictionary. The function and module chapter will let you know how to organize a large code. The built-in functions and modulesÊlike collections will give you greater flexibility to write efficient codes. The \"time\" chapter is very important when we deal with time-related things.ÊÊ The mid-chapter contains the advance chapters such as regular expressions, interactionÊwith OS, and multithreading. These chapters are helpful when we want to search the pattern, run the OS commands, and execute the program in parallel. The last chapters are specially designed from an industry point of view.ÊIn order to ensure a high quality of code, we use config-parser to avoid hard-coding and logger to log the events. In the multiprocessing and subprocess chapter, you will learn creation, execution, and communication between the processes.Ê KEY FEATURESÊÊ Start from basics of PythonÊ Control statement, loop structure, break, continue, and pass statementÊ Detailed description of Python data types: string, tuple, list, and dictionary with the help of example Organizing code using function, modules, and packages Saving text and complex data in text, pickle, and JSON files Learn the use of time and time zones Parallel execution with the help of threading, multiprocessing, and subprocessing Helpful modules for industry WHAT WILL YOU LEARNÊ Python for developers is created by taking beginner and intermediate programmers. The book starts from scratch and takes you to the advanced level. After learning advance levels, you will learn parallel programming using multithreading, multiprocessing, and sub-processing. The book will provide information on modules which will be helpful form industry perspective. The book also contains the question for the preparation of the interview. You will also learn the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. Some of the chapters include an advance part, which will give an in-depth knowledge of the chapters.Ê WHO THIS BOOK IS FORÊÊ This book is for whoever wants to learn Python and aspires to become a developer or work on projects.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you\\'ll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python\\'s great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python\\'s newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft\\'s newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python\\'s built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer\\'s library. Praise for the First Edition: \"In a nutshell, Python in a Nutshell serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\" --Richard Cobbett, Linux Format \"O\\'Reilly has several good books, of which Python in aNutshell by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\" --Jerry Pournelle, Byte Magazine',\n",

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.\",\n",

With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This book covers: Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects Data structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age Functions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns Object-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance Control flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages Metaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work',\n",

Students and researchers at all levels are increasingly turning to the powerful Python programming language as an alternative to commercial packages and this fast-paced introduction moves from the basics to advanced concepts in one complete volume, enabling readers to gain proficiency quickly. Beginning with general programming concepts such as loops and functions within the core Python 3 language, and moving on to the NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib libraries for numerical programming and data visualization, this textbook also discusses the use of Jupyter Notebooks to build rich-media, shareable documents for scientific analysis. The second edition features a new chapter on data analysis with the pandas library and comprehensive updates, and new exercises and examples. A final chapter introduces more advanced topics such as floating-point precision and algorithm stability, and extensive online resources support further study. This textbook represents a targeted package for students requiring a solid foundation in Python programming.',\n",

In all of these areas, experienced professionals can find examples of inefficiency, problems, and other perils, as a result of bad code. After reading this book, readers will understand these problems, and more importantly, how to correct them. The book begins by describing the basic elements of writing clean code and how it plays an important role in Python programming. You will learn about writing efficient and readable code using the Python standard library and best practices for software design. You will learn to implement the SOLID principles in Python and use decorators to improve your code. The book delves more deeply into object oriented programming in Python and shows you how to use objects with descriptors and generators. It will also show you the design principles of software testing and how to resolve software problems by implementing design patterns in your code. In the final chapter we break down a monolithic application to a microservice one, starting from the code as the basis for a solid platform. By the end of the book, you will be proficient in applying industry approved coding practices to design clean, sustainable and readable Python code. What you will learn Set up tools to effectively work in a development environment Explore how the magic methods of Python can help us write better code Examine the traits of Python to create advanced object-oriented design Understand removal of duplicated code using decorators and descriptors Effectively refactor code with the help of unit tests Learn to implement the SOLID principles in Python Who this book is for This book will appeal to team leads, software architects and senior software engineers who would like to work on their legacy systems to save cost and improve efficiency.

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that’s no fun for anyone. Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side. Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you’ll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more. As you strike out on your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to: –Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps –Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules –Use control structures like loops and conditional statements –Draw shapes and patterns with Python’s turtle module –Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter Why should serious adults have all the fun? Python for Kids is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming. For kids ages 10+ (and their parents) The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!',\n",

And whether it’s a vintage screensaver, a snail-racing game, a clickbait headline generator, or animated strands of DNA, each project is designed to be self-contained so you can easily share it online. You’ll create: • Hangman, Blackjack, and other games to play against your friends or the computer • Simulations of a forest fire, a million dice rolls, and a Japanese abacus • Animations like a virtual fish tank, a rotating cube, and a bouncing DVD logo screensaver • A first-person 3D maze game • Encryption programs that use ciphers like ROT13 and Vigenère to conceal text If you’re tired of standard step-by-step tutorials, you’ll love the learn-by-doing approach of The Big Book of Small Python Projects. It’s proof that good things come in small programs!',\n",

Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs. What you will learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Extend class functionality using inheritance Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important Learn to statically type check your dynamic code Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs Who this book is for If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.\",\n",

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward. With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture) Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage Events, commands, and the message bus Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices',\n",

Despite this, the text builds up to advanced topics such as automated testing, creating documentation, versioning and updating a package, and implementing continuous integration and deployment. Covering the entire Python packaging life cycle, this essential guide takes readers from package creation all the way to effective maintenance and updating. Python Packages focuses on the use of current and best-practice packaging tools and services like poetry, cookiecutter, pytest, sphinx, GitHub, and GitHub Actions. Features: The book’s source code is available online as a GitHub repository where it is collaborated on, automatically tested, and built in real time as changes are made; demonstrating the use of good reproducible and clear project workflows. Covers not just the process of creating a package, but also how to document it, test it, publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI), and how to properly version and update it. All concepts in the book are demonstrated using examples. Readers can follow along, creating their own Python packages using the reproducible code provided in the text. Focuses on a modern approach to Python packaging with emphasis on automating and streamlining the packaging process using new and emerging tools such as poetry and GitHub Actions.',\n",

With this hands-on book, you can master the fundamentals of the core Python language quickly and efficiently, whether you're new to programming or just new to Python. Once you finish, you will know enough about the language to use it in any application domain you choose. Learning Python is based on material from author Mark Lutz's popular training courses, which he's taught over the past decade. Each chapter is a self-contained lesson that helps you thoroughly understand a key component of Python before you continue. Along with plenty of annotated examples, illustrations, and chapter summaries, every chapter also contains Brain Builder, a unique section with practical exercises and review quizzes that let you practice new skills and test your understanding as you go. This book covers: Types and Operations -- Python's major built-in object types in depth: numbers, lists, dictionaries, and more Statements and Syntax -- the code you type to create and process objects in Python, along with Python's general syntax model Functions -- Python's basic procedural tool for structuring and reusing code Modules -- packages of statements, functions, and other tools organized into larger components Classes and OOP -- Python's optional object-oriented programming tool for structuring code for customization and reuse Exceptions and Tools -- exception handling model and statements, plus a look at development tools for writing larger programs Learning Python gives you a deep and complete understanding of the language that will help you comprehend any application-level examples of Python that you later encounter. If you're ready to discover what Google and YouTube see in Python, this book is the best way to get started.\",\n",

Begin by building classic games like Hangman, Guess the Number, and Tic-Tac-Toe, and then work your way up to more advanced games, like a text-based treasure hunting game and an animated collision-dodging game with sound effects. Along the way, you’ll learn key programming and math concepts that will help you take your game programming to the next level. Learn how to: –Combine loops, variables, and flow control statements into real working programs –Choose the right data structures for the job, such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples –Add graphics and animation to your games with the pygame module –Handle keyboard and mouse input –Program simple artificial intelligence so you can play against the computer –Use cryptography to convert text messages into secret code –Debug your programs and find common errors As you work through each game, you’ll build a solid foundation in Python and an understanding of computer science fundamentals. What new game will you create with the power of Python? The projects in this book are compatible with Python 3.',\n",

In fact, it's the top feature requested. What makes this combination so compelling? In this hands-on guide, Felix Zumstein--creator of xlwings, a popular open source package for automating Excel with Python--shows experienced Excel users how to integrate these two worlds efficiently. Excel has added quite a few new capabilities over the past couple of years, but its automation language, VBA, stopped evolving a long time ago. Many Excel power users have already adopted Python for daily automation tasks. This guide gets you started. Use Python without extensive programming knowledge Get started with modern tools, including Jupyter notebooks and Visual Studio code Use pandas to acquire, clean, and analyze data and replace typical Excel calculations Automate tedious tasks like consolidation of Excel workbooks and production of Excel reports Use xlwings to build interactive Excel tools that use Python as a calculation engine Connect Excel to databases and CSV files and fetch data from the internet using Python code Use Python as a single tool to replace VBA, Power Query, and Power Pivot\",\n",

With code and relevant case studies, this book will show how you can use industry-grade tools to implement NLP programs capable of learning from relevant data. We will explore many modern methods ranging from spaCy to word vectors that have reinvented NLP. The book takes you from the basics of NLP to building text processing applications. We start with an introduction to the basic vocabulary along with a workflow for building NLP applications. We use industry-grade NLP tools for cleaning and pre-processing text, automatic question and answer generation using linguistics, text embedding, text classifier, and building a chatbot. With each project, you will learn a new concept of NLP. You will learn about entity recognition, part of speech tagging and dependency parsing for Q and A. We use text embedding for both clustering documents and making chatbots, and then build classifiers using scikit-learn. We conclude by deploying these models as REST APIs with Flask. By the end, you will be confident building NLP applications, and know exactly what to look for when approaching new challenges. What you will learnUnderstand classical linguistics in using English grammar for automatically generating questions and answers from a free text corpusWork with text embedding models for dense number representations of words, subwords and characters in the English language for exploring document clusteringDeep Learning in NLP using PyTorch with a code-driven introduction to PyTorchUsing an NLP project management Framework for estimating timelines and organizing your project into stagesHack and build a simple chatbot application in 30 minutesDeploy an NLP or machine learning application using Flask as RESTFUL APIsWho this book is for Programmers who wish to build systems that can interpret language.

This book is designed in such a way that you start from basics, followed by advance levels and then move on to some industry-related modules.Ê The initial chapters are written in a simple manner; some chapters are of advanceÊlevel. Start from the data structure of Python, such as string, list, tuple, and dictionary. The function and module chapter will let you know how to organize a large code. The built-in functions and modulesÊlike collections will give you greater flexibility to write efficient codes. The \"time\" chapter is very important when we deal with time-related things.ÊÊ The mid-chapter contains the advance chapters such as regular expressions, interactionÊwith OS, and multithreading. These chapters are helpful when we want to search the pattern, run the OS commands, and execute the program in parallel. The last chapters are specially designed from an industry point of view.ÊIn order to ensure a high quality of code, we use config-parser to avoid hard-coding and logger to log the events. In the multiprocessing and subprocess chapter, you will learn creation, execution, and communication between the processes.Ê KEY FEATURESÊÊ Start from basics of PythonÊ Control statement, loop structure, break, continue, and pass statementÊ Detailed description of Python data types: string, tuple, list, and dictionary with the help of example Organizing code using function, modules, and packages Saving text and complex data in text, pickle, and JSON files Learn the use of time and time zones Parallel execution with the help of threading, multiprocessing, and subprocessing Helpful modules for industry WHAT WILL YOU LEARNÊ Python for developers is created by taking beginner and intermediate programmers. The book starts from scratch and takes you to the advanced level. After learning advance levels, you will learn parallel programming using multithreading, multiprocessing, and sub-processing. The book will provide information on modules which will be helpful form industry perspective. The book also contains the question for the preparation of the interview. You will also learn the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. Some of the chapters include an advance part, which will give an in-depth knowledge of the chapters.Ê WHO THIS BOOK IS FORÊÊ This book is for whoever wants to learn Python and aspires to become a developer or work on projects. Beginners can read this book easily; however, a little knowledge about the programming concepts would be helpful. Basic knowledge of computers would suffice. Table of Contents 1.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you\\'ll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python\\'s great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python\\'s newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft\\'s newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python\\'s built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer\\'s library. Praise for the First Edition: \"In a nutshell, Python in a Nutshell serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\" --Richard Cobbett, Linux Format \"O\\'Reilly has several good books, of which Python in aNutshell by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\" --Jerry Pournelle, Byte Magazine',\n",
